# Student Submission Integrity Diagnosis

Student Submission Integrity Diagnosis (SSID) is a Ruby on Rails web application suite for managing courses, assignments, staff, teaching assistants, students, and student code submissions and most importantly, to **detect and visualize plagiarism** among student code submissions. 

SSID works with lexers based on [ANTLR Grammars](http://www.antlr.org/grammar/list) so if you can find / write a grammar for it, SSID can detect and visualize plagiarism for it. SSID uses the [JavaScript InfoVis Toolkit](http://philogb.github.com/jit/) for its plagiarism visualization. Code display and syntax highlighting is handled by [google-code-prettify](http://code.google.com/p/google-code-prettify/).
